# fastPyDroneSim

## Description

<!--- Provide description of the contents of the code repository   
    * Provide information about what the code does  
    * Provide links for demos, blog posts, etc. (if applicable)  
    * Mention any caveats and assumptions that were considered  
-->  

Fast drone sim in python (currently linear quadrotors only). Vectorized on CPU
cranking about 5M timesteps per second on a laptop i7. 
Also vectorized for GPU with up to 250M timesteps per second (RTX A1000), but if
the state at every time step needs to be logged and be available to the CPU after simulation, then
that number reduces to 20M or so.

Visuals in THREE.js with a websocket connection, inspired by the Learning to Fly in Seconds paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13081).

This gif shows the visualization of 512 quadrotors, although 8192 were simulated on a RTX A1000 graphics card.

## Requirements  

Ubuntu 22.04 tested only. Visuals require docker.

Python dependencies can be installed with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


### CUDA

Cuda can be a hassle to install. For Ubuntu 22.04 on my machine, the following
worked, but there may be (must be!) easier ways, perhaps with a different version.

- Delete all current nvidia things `sudo apt purge "nvidia-*" "libnvidia-*" "cuda-*" "linux-modules-nvidia-*"`
- `sudo apt autoremove`
- Make sure that "Using X.Org X server" is selected in "Software & Updates" > "Additional Drivers"
- Compile the latests 550 driver from scratch for your kernel (`6.1.0-1036-oem` in my case)
```
sudo apt install gcc-12
sudo update-alternatives --install  /usr/bin/cc cc /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc-12 100
```
- download the runscript from https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/218826/en-us/. Terminate x-server and run
```
chmod +x ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.54.14.run
sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.54.14.run        # say yes to everything
```

- reboot and do ONLY the "Base Installer" step of https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=deb_network
- finally, install cuda and some other things

```
sudo apt install cuda-driver-550 nvidia-compute-utils-550
```


<!--- Add badges of requirements e.g.:  
    [![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6-3776AB)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)  
-->  

<!--- Provide details of the software required   
    * Add a `requirements.txt` file to the root directory for installing the necessary dependencies.   
    * Describe how to install requirements e.g. when using pip:  

        To install requirements:

        ```
            setup
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    * Alternatively, create an INSTALL.md. 
    * Provide any further instructions on how others can make sure the scripts are running for benchmarking examples (e.g. by using computational notebooks such as Jupyter notebooks) 
-->


## Running


### Visuals

Build docker image of the webserver for the visuals

    docker build -t devserver . -f dockerfile

Run it with

    docker run -it --net host -v ./static:/usr/app/static devserver

Open the URL reported by the docker container in a WebGL capable browser.


### Simulation

    ipython -i sim.py

Check options at the top of `sim.py` for configuration.
